 - If client quits while glbd is busy connecting to a destination, established
   and queued connections from glbd to destinations may remain. I.e. client
   quit / connection close goes unnoticed because of prebuffered packets.
 - Doesn't check if destination is glbd itself and goes into infinite loop
 - Doesn't handle SIGPIPE
 - splice() refuses to read from socket returning with EINVAL.
   Apparently special kernel support is needed: tcp_splice_read()
