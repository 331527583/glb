- Fixed obscure connection loss when too many connections are initiated at once.
- Fixed segfault when -s option was specified.
- Added TCP_NODELAY option to sockets (on by default)
- Added start/stop script and config template to run glbd as a "service".
- Implemented basic IP-based source tracking mechanism
  (same IP clients directed to the same server).
  Version 0.8.0

2012-05-17 alex 
- Fixed glb_sockaddr_t initialization + compilation cleanups.
  Version 0.7.5

2010-02-15 teemu 
- Fixed usage counting bug when usage could become negative when all
  destinations fail simultaneously.
  Version 0.7.4

2009-11-04 alex 
- Compilation cleanups for gcc-4.4.1

2009-09-11 alex 
- Router lock is no longer held while connecting. However destination table
  modification is still blocked.

2009-07-25 alex 
- Logging cleanups: converted the last of fprintfs and perrors to use logger.
  Version 0.7.3

2009-06-07 alex 
- Fixed:
  * Off-by-one bug which threw control thread into a tight loop when using FIFO
    control method.
  * listener thread was still using select().
  Version 0.7.2

2009-04-18 alex 
- Fixed:
  * control thread was still using select() to listen to requests (FD_SETSIZE
    descriptor limit).
  * reverted "fix" which opened control socket by default for security and
    usability considerations.
  Version 0.7.1.

2009-04-16 alex 
- Added machine parsable stats output on 'getstat' command
- Fixed:
  * control socket was not opened by default
  * usage display if weight was not 0 or 1
  * real numbers were not accepted for destination weight
  Version 0.7.0.

2009-04-15 alex 
- Refactored to use poll/epoll API instead of select(). This allows for more
  than FD_SETSIZE/2 concurrent connections and is considerably faster in case
  of epoll.

2009-03-12 alex 
- Cosmetic changes to the output: usage now ranges strictly from 0.0
  (unused) to 1.0 (overloaded). Weight 0.0 automatically means usage 1.0,
  before that it was 'nan'. Version 0.6.3.

2009-02-10 alex 
- Fixed non-working destination failover, failed destinations are retried
  every 2 seconds. Version 0.6.2.

2009-01-07 alex 
- Fixed silly destination list parsing bug. Version 0.6.1.

2008-09-14 alex 
- Fixed a problem with default port when adding destinations during runtime.
- Changed from comma-separated destination list to space-separated
  destination list, hence bumped minor version.

2008-07-15 alex 
- Initial release.
