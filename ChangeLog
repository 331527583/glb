- Refactored to use poll/epoll API instead of select(). This allows for more
  than FD_SETSIZE/2 concurrent connections and is considerably faster in case
  of epoll. Version 0.7.0.

- Cosmetic changes to the output: usage now ranges strictly from 0.0
  (unused) to 1.0 (overloaded). Weight 0.0 automatically means usage 1.0,
  before that it was 'nan'. Version 0.6.3.
