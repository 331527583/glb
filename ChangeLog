- Fixed libglb initialization.
- Fixed GLB_OPTIONS parsing in libglb, which didn't actually work.
- Added logging to libglb in debug build and support for --verbose option.
  Version 1.0.0

2013-01-21 alex 
- Added automatic Galera node discovery (-D|--discover option).
- Added GLB_OPTIONS env. variable to set misc. options for libglb.
- Added a sample curl script for checking HTTP servers.
- Fixed a bunch of leaks and uninitialized values shown by valgrind.
  Version 1.0.0beta

2013-01-18 alex 
  Merged with version 0.9.2:
- New option -T|--top: all policies use only top-weighted destinations for
  routing. E.g. in the presence of destinations with weights 1 and 2 only
  the latter will be used to route connections to until all of them fail.
- New policy 'single': all connections are directed to only one destination
  chosen by highest weight.
- Added SO_KEEPALIVE option to server side sockets to avoid stalled connections
  Version 1.0.0alpha4

2013-01-10 alex 
- Merged in asynchronous connection processing from 0.9.1 and other missing
  fixes from the trunk.
  Version 1.0.0alpha3

2012-12-23 alex 
- Implemented initial watchdog framework that asynchronously monitors
  destinations using server-spceific probes and updates routing table
  accordingly. (Destination discovery is not supported yet)
- Implemented basic watchdog module that spawns destination probes via shell,
  allowing various probing scripts to be written.
- Added ability to use watchdog probes to probe destinations immediately before
  connect.
  Version 1.0.0alpha2

2012-12-19 alex 
- Fixed division by 0 when destination list is empty introduced by
  "round-robin" policy support.
  Version 0.9.0

2012-12-09 alex 
- added "round-robin" balancing policy.
- made "random" and "source tracking" policies to obey destination weight.
- libglb: a shared library that adds balancing capabilities to any application
  without recompilation.
  Version 0.9.0beta

2012-12-05 alex 
- *HOTFIX*: fixed slow MySQL connection initiation due to TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT
  enabled by default. Now it is an option.
- added "random" load balancing policy.
  Version 0.8.2

2012-12-01 alex 
- Fixed privileges issue when using service script and default FIFO location.
- Implemented maximum connections option which both limits maximum client
  connections and also tries to increase OS open files limit if necessary.
- Added MAX_CONN parameter to start/stop script.
  Version 0.8.1

2012-11-30 alex 
- Fixed obscure connection loss when too many connections are initiated at once.
- Fixed segfault when -s option was specified.
- Added TCP_NODELAY option to sockets (on by default)
- Added start/stop script and config template to run glbd as a "service".
- Implemented basic IP-based source tracking mechanism
  (same IP clients directed to the same server).
  Version 0.8.0

2012-05-17 alex 
- Fixed glb_sockaddr_t initialization + compilation cleanups.
  Version 0.7.5

2010-02-15 teemu 
- Fixed usage counting bug when usage could become negative when all
  destinations fail simultaneously.
  Version 0.7.4

2009-11-04 alex 
- Compilation cleanups for gcc-4.4.1

2009-09-11 alex 
- Router lock is no longer held while connecting. However destination table
  modification is still blocked.

2009-07-25 alex 
- Logging cleanups: converted the last of fprintfs and perrors to use logger.
  Version 0.7.3

2009-06-07 alex 
- Fixed:
  * Off-by-one bug which threw control thread into a tight loop when using FIFO
    control method.
  * listener thread was still using select().
  Version 0.7.2

2009-04-18 alex 
- Fixed:
  * control thread was still using select() to listen to requests (FD_SETSIZE
    descriptor limit).
  * reverted "fix" which opened control socket by default for security and
    usability considerations.
  Version 0.7.1.

2009-04-16 alex 
- Added machine parsable stats output on 'getstat' command
- Fixed:
  * control socket was not opened by default
  * usage display if weight was not 0 or 1
  * real numbers were not accepted for destination weight
  Version 0.7.0.

2009-04-15 alex 
- Refactored to use poll/epoll API instead of select(). This allows for more
  than FD_SETSIZE/2 concurrent connections and is considerably faster in case
  of epoll.

2009-03-12 alex 
- Cosmetic changes to the output: usage now ranges strictly from 0.0
  (unused) to 1.0 (overloaded). Weight 0.0 automatically means usage 1.0,
  before that it was 'nan'. Version 0.6.3.

2009-02-10 alex 
- Fixed non-working destination failover, failed destinations are retried
  every 2 seconds. Version 0.6.2.

2009-01-07 alex 
- Fixed silly destination list parsing bug. Version 0.6.1.

2008-09-14 alex 
- Fixed a problem with default port when adding destinations during runtime.
- Changed from comma-separated destination list to space-separated
  destination list, hence bumped minor version.

2008-07-15 alex 
- Initial release.
